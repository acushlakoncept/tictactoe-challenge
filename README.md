## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure Node.js is running on your local machine

### Setup

~~~bash
$ git clone git@github.com:acushlakoncept/tictactoe-challenge.git
$ cd tictactoe-challenge
~~~

Install modules:

```
yarn add
```
### Usage

Start server with:

```
    yarn start or npm start
```
### Running Test
Jest is used to run all the tests found in this application
In order to run the test you can simply type `yarn test` or `npm run test`

Either ways, if you encounter any error while running either command, its likely you do not have `jest` installed globally, so please run `npm install -g jest-cli` then try again. That should do it.
